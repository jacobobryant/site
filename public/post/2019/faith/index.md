{:title "The Rationality of Faith", :date "2019-08-24"}

Before we decide if something is true or not (e.g. "is there a God?"), we need
to have some kind of process for deciding. So what is that process? I'll quote
Steven Pinker:

> In reality, science... looks more like Bayesian reasoning.... A theory is
> granted a prior degree of credence, based on its consistency with everything
> else we know. That level of credence is then incremented or decremented
> according to how likely an empirical observation would be if the theory is

You could visualize Bayesian reasoning by imagining a set of balance scales. As
an example, say the left side represents the theory "it rained recently" while
the right side represents "it didn't rain recently." The scale's initial
weighting represents our prior degree of credence: if we're in Utah, then the
right side of the scale would be weighted quite heavily, but it would be
weighted less heavily if we're in Malaysia.

Now suppose we make an observation: the sidewalk is wet. If it rained recently,
than this would be an incredibly likely observation to make. The observation
would be less likely if it didn't rain recently. So, we'll add some weight to
the left side of the scale.

But how much weight do we add? It depends on two things:

1. How plausible are other explanations for the sidewalk being wet?
2. Based on our prior knowledge, how rare or common do we think rain is?

In Utah, sprinklers are a great explanation for wet sidewalks. In addition,
rain is pretty rare. So I would put only a little extra weight on the left side
of the scale&mdash;the right side would still be weighted more heavily, because even
given that the sidewalk is wet, I still think it's more likely that it didn't
rain recently.

Things would be different in Malaysia. I never saw a sprinkler while I lived
there, and it rains pretty much every day. I would put a lot of weight on the
left side of the scale, definitely enough that it would outweigh the right side.

This is the same way I think about the existence of God. My prior knowledge
consists of all the secular evidence for or against the existence of God (or at
least, the portion of that evidence that I've come across). By "secular
evidence," I mean roughly anything that might be permissible in an academic
journal. This includes historical information, analyses of the textual content
of scriptures, evidence about evolution, etc.

Besides secular evidence, I have the evidence of personal experiences. Although
these experiences are hard to replicate and thus can't be published in a journal,
they're still empirical and thus should be considered. There are many
written accounts of what these experiences sometimes feel like. Luke 24:32:

> ... Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and
> while he opened to us the scriptures?

Joseph Smith&mdash;History 1:11-12:

> 11\. ... I was one day reading the Epistle of James, first chapter and fifth verse....

Russell M. Nelson, describing an experience performing surgery:

Doctrine and Covenants 6:22-23:

> 22\. ... cast your mind upon the night that you cried unto me in your heart, that
> you might know concerning the truth of these things.
>

There are both natural and supernatural explanations for these observations.
They could be direct communication from God, or they could be the result of
ordinary biological processes (i.e. "it's all in your head"). Each person who
has such an experience has to estimate what the likelihood of that experience
occurring would be if God exists and what the likelihood would be if God
doesn't exist.

So, let's say Alice has had one or more of these personal experiences, and
she's convinced that they would be very likely to happen if God exists and very
unlikely to happen if God didn't exist. So does that mean, if she uses Bayesian
reasoning, that she believes God exists? *Not necessarily.* It depends on her
prior knowledge.

Let me illustrate with another example from Bayesian statistics. This example is
so commonly used that I'll just quote it from the first source that came up on
Google:

> Suppose that you are worried that you might have a rare disease. You decide to

> 99 percent of the time (in other words, if you have the disease, it shows that

>

In this example, our prior knowledge is that only 1 in 10,000 people has the
disease. The observation at hand is that our test came up positive. In other
words, our current observation says that there's a 99% chance we have the
disease, but our prior knowledge says there's a *99.99% chance* we *don't* have
the disease. The test results are overpowered by the strength of our prior
knowledge. On the other hand, if 50% of the general population had this
disease, then a positive test result would be strong evidence that we have the
disease.

Back to Alice. Her personal experiences are like the medical test. They may be
quite strong, but they could still be overpowered by her prior knowledge. If
she finds the secular evidence to be quite in favor of God not existing, her
personal experiences may not be enough to sway her mind&mdash;and this is perfectly
rational.

So, if you're like Alice and you're trying to decide if you still believe in
God or not, trying to seek stronger personal evidence may be a dead end.
Instead, you may be better off investigating the secular evidence more deeply.
You might find that it's less biased than you first assumed.

**Faith**

The previous section covers *methodology*. What I've tried to explain is that
even in the context of spiritual matters, I attempt to use standard Bayesian
reasoning&mdash;a rational methodology. So what is faith, and where does it come
in?

First, we should be clear that faith is a complex subject, and the scriptures
use the term in multiple ways.[4] But in the context of deciding whether or not
we believe in God at all, I think of faith as *rational thinking in the face of
uncertainty,* or in other words, a willingness to accept risk.

Humans are often risk-averse and afraid of uncertainty. However, if you make
only choices that seem low-risk, you're likely to end up with a suboptimal
outcome in the long-run. For many, choosing to marry someone is a decision that
comes inseparably bundled with a high amount of uncertainty and risk&mdash;but that
doesn't imply the right choice is to simply not get married. You have to learn
to act rationally despite the uncertainty.

It's the same with faith. Let's consider Bob, the inverse of Alice. His prior
knowledge is such that he's willing to consider the existence of God, although
alone it probably isn't enough to make him confident that God does in fact
exist. Since he hasn't had any personal/spiritual experiences yet, his best bet
would be to try validating some claims about how to have these experiences. For
example, Moroni 10:4:

> And when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye would ask
> God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true;
> and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in
> Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy
> Ghost.

And John 7:17:

> If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be
> of God, or whether I speak of myself.

Both these claims state that spiritual experiences have prerequisites; they
don't just happen. The claims can't be tested without fulfilling the
prerequisites, and often those prerequisites can't be fulfilled without
significant personal sacrifice. If Bob has an irrational fear of
uncertainty&mdash;or in other words, a lack of faith&mdash;he would probably be unwilling
to try testing the claims at all. Even if God does exist, Bob might never know
it.

Let's say Bob does test the claims, and he has some spiritual experiences. The
evidence may be strong enough that, rationally, Bob should presume God exists
and thus live his life accordingly. But even with these spiritual experiences,
Bob probably won't be 100% confident. If Bob lacks faith, being less than 100%
confident might make him too uncomfortable. He might then irrationally decide
to ignore the evidence and continue with the assumption that God doesn't exist.

**Faith and reason**

Many people believe that faith and reason are separate. Interestingly, both
believers and nonbelievers hold this position. Of course, they have different
implications. The nonbelievers who hold this position think that because faith
and reason are separate, you should throw faith out. The believers who hold
this position think you should instead compartmentalize faith and
reason&mdash;reason should be used in science, and faith should be used in religion.

I think both these positions are off, though. Faith and reason, in their purest
forms, are the same thing. The same method of epistemology can, and should, be
used in both science and religion. We don't have to disagree about methodology.

Importantly, Alice and Bob could end up with different conclusions, even if
they both use the same methodology. They've been exposed to different subsets
of the available secular evidence, and of course they've had different
personal experiences. But let's recognize that *that's* why they
disagree&mdash;different sets of evidence and different interpretations of it, not
irrationality or faithlessness.

**Appendix: Scientific thought vs. rational thought**

Scientific thought is a strict subset of rational thought. Rational thought just
means that you try to have good reasons for the things you believe and do. But
science is more restrictive. For example:

 - Skepticism. The evidence required to believe a claim is relatively high.

 - Verifiability. Evidence (e.g. experimental results) is only considered valid
   if it can be reliably verified by others.

So scientific thought tends to be fairly conservative. This has been effective
because it helps to ensure slow but steady progress. Humans throughout history
have been prone to believe lots of things that aren't true, and science puts a
damper on that.

That conservativeness has inevitable consequences: it makes you more prone to
false negatives, where you disbelieve something that actually is true. That's
usually a good tradeoff because we'd rather have lots of false negatives and
relatively few false positives than vice-versa. False negatives are often only
temporary, anyway. We may not believe a claim yet, but we can change our minds
after more evidence is gathered. On the other hand, if you have lots of false
positives, then they can build on each other. You can waste a lot of time going
down a path that's based on a false positive (like alchemy).

Scientific thought is well-suited for many things. However, no one would argue
that you should restrict yourself to scientific thought in every situation. The
classic example is love. If you apply skepticism and verifiability to your
relationships, your conclusion will always be that you're not in love. Another
example is startups. Most of the returns are concentrated in a few outliers.
Conservative, scientific thinking in many cases would cause you to not work on
or invest in the best startups. If you tell yourself that you only believe
things which are supported by scientific thought, then you're precluding
certain beliefs based on the axioms (e.g. skepticism, verifiability) you've
adopted&mdash;no evidence necessary.

Belief in God is sometimes put at odds with rational and/or scientific thought,
but the distinction between scientific and rational thought is usually not
addressed. That's critical. I'd agree that belief in God doesn't fall within
scientific thought. I do think it can fall under rational thought.
