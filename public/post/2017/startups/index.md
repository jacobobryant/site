{:title "Big Ideas (rough draft)", :date "2017-12-07"}

Problem/solution pairs are listed in the order in which I thought of
them as I wrote this post. This is meant to be a listing of all the
ideas I want to implement, but it doesn't contain full descriptions.


**Problem**: For people who want to create startups, it's hard to meet and
network with potential cofounders.

**Solution hypothesis**: A networking website where people can talk about
ideas for projects they want to do/are already working on. Websites
like founderdating.com focus explicitly on finding cofounders, but
this website would just focus on facilitating discussion about
interesting projects. Finding cofounders would just be a side effect.
We'd especially try to facilitate discussion between people who are
geographically close together and who don't know each other, but it'd
also be useful for people who already know each other to keep up to
date on each others ideas/projects. Market it especially towards
university students.


**Problem**: The education system sucks.

**Solution hypothesis**: See [my post on education](https://jacobobryant.com/post/2017/education/).


**Problem**: Specifically, CS education could use a lot of improvement.

**Solution hypothesis**: For BYU specifically: allow students to get
more credit for working on their own projects. Facilitate students
working together on these projects. Outcomes: 1) students network with
each other, 2) students learn to work on teams, 3) students get
a better learning experience instead of having to learn everything
through coursework. Coming soon: An in-depth post on my
recommendations to improve BYU's CS program.


**Problem**: Also specifically, it's hard for people to learn programming.

**Solution hypothesis**: An online resource that provides an
overview/roadmap of the software field. It would describe different
things you can do with programming and what things you need to learn
to get there. It would contain links to other resources that you could
use to actually learn the material described in the roadmap. As
needed, we could create our own online courses that are tailored to
beginners. See [roadmap](https://jacobobryant.com/prog/roadmap/).
Short term strategy: market to parents of homeschooled middle/high
school aged kids as a multi-year computer science curriculum. Mid-term
strategy: Extend into the university level computer science space.
Market the product as a better alternative to getting a bachelor's
degree in CS. Long-term strategy: Use this project as a foot in the
door to implementing the [education
scheme](https://jacobobryant.com/post/2017/education/). Displace
university education in general, in addition to probably high school
and middle school.


**Problem**: Listening to music you like/finding new music/managing music
collections still takes too much time and effort.

**Solution hypothesis**: A music app with a better recommendation
algorithm. Only input is skip track or keep listening. The app learns
what songs to play based on your history. Also the app integrates
multiple streaming/cloud services with your local music collection.
All your music in one place, and it knows exactly which song to play
without you having to choose a station or anything.


**Problem**: It's hard to create production quality music without selling
your soul to a record label. Corollary: music consumption is heavily
restricted by copyright.

**Solution hypothesis**: Open-source the music making process. Create some
sort of "Github for musicians." Make it so musicians can succeed just
fine without record labels. Especially focus on amateur musicians.
Hopefully we can create a system where musicians can thrive but
digital music can also be free.


**Problem**: It takes too much time/effort to be politically active.

**Solution hypothesis**: A politician recommendation system. You tell
the system what issues are important to you and what your stances are.
The system helps you to use your vote wisely. It knows what
politicians you're eligible to vote for. It uses the politician's
voting record to show how well they represent your political
preferences. This creates accountability for the politicians.
