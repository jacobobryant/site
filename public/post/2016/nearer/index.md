I recently performed the hymn "Nearer, Dear Savior, To Thee" in church. I
adapted it from <a href="http://www.musicbyandrew.ca/nearerdearsavior.html">a
great arrangement</a> by Andrew Hawryluk. I condensed the choir parts into a
clarinet solo, adding some ornamentation to the third verse. The piano part is
the same. In addition to the PDF, I've included the lilypond source code so
others can modify it further if desired.

To anyone thinking about performing this, I would recommend taking out a phrase
or two somewhere in the middle to give you a chance to catch your breath
(perhaps rest in measures 67-70 and let the piano take over). The run in
measure 82 was intended as a quick glissando, but I stretched it out to make it
easier to play. The score I made is sparse on dynamics and articulation, so
think about how you want to play it. The video will show you how I chose to do
it. Lastly, the original score is already sharp-heavy, and the transposition to
Bb only adds to the fun. So hopefully you know your scales :)
