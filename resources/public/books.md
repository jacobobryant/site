Every book here is one that I have read and highly recommend. No mediocre
books. Listed in no particular order. I'd like to add a little commentary
eventually. And while they aren't books, I have to specifically mention
[the essays of Paul Graham](http://paulgraham.com/articles.html) which have had a
tremendous impact on the way I see the world.
