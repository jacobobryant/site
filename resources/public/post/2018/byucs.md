In December 2017 I graduated from BYU with a CS degree. I had a good education, but
I've thought a lot about how to make things better.

*Summary: students don't have enough time to work on personal projects, and
there isn't enough peer-to-peer interaction. We can solve both these problems
by allowing them to either 1) get more credit for personal projects or 2) work
on personal projects as a part-time job, and by facilitating
collaboration on these projects.*

**First pain**

My education has benefited greatly from three separate areas: classes, jobs and
personal projects. Unfortunately, it was difficult to find time to work on my
own projects. These projects are beneficial for several reasons.

First, you choose what to build, so you can learn about things that interest
you. That helps build enduring motivation. Furthermore, you aren't restricted to
what the curriculum offers. For example, the current curriculum emphasizes
object-oriented programming, but there's almost no mention of functional
programming. I learned functional programming by using Clojure in my personal
projects.

Second, because personal projects aren't so deadline-driven, you can afford to
spend time learning in an exploratory style instead of just trying to complete
the requirements as quickly as possible (as opposed to class projects which
often result in ugly code). You can take time to learn the best, most elegant
way to do things.

Finally, personal projects potentially have real users. You can practice
identifying users' needs, coming up with a possible solution, getting feedback
and revising the solution. You can find out how hard getting users is but how
gratifying it is to build something that improves their lives. This is a
powerful experience.

But between a full load of classes and a part-time job, there's not much free time
left over for personal projects.

**Second pain**

Networking with other students is also critical. As a would-be startup founder,
I need to build relationships with potential cofounders. But regardless of
specific life goals, everyone needs to know other capable students. This
results in better opportunities to work on important things together later on.
However, I hardly knew any of the other CS students. The core curriculum
doesn't foster much student interaction. There are extra-curricular activities
like clubs and hackathons, but I rarely had time for those things.

**Solution hypothesis**

The general solution to this problem is to help students carve out time for
personal projects and to facilitate collaboration on those projects (there's no
better way to know someone else than to work with them).

For students to have time for personal projects, the projects need to replace
either some classes or a part-time job. (Replacing a social life would be another
option if any CS students had one). There are two possibilities:

1. Give students credit for personal projects. For example, a student could be
   allowed to get up to 3 credits per semester for these projects. This option
   obviously would have to be implemented by the CS department.

2. Pay students to work on personal projects. Instead of having a normal
   part-time job, they could be sponsored by a company to work on their project
   outside of classes. This could be a valuable recruiting opportunity for
   companies. Summer internships already provide industry experience for
   students, so students wouldn't be missing out by not having a regular
   part-time job.

To facilitate collaboration, students need a way to freely share ideas about
projects and form teams. One possibility is a Slack workspace dedicated to
personal projects. Each project has its own channel which is used for progress
updates and other communication about the project. Students can browse current
projects, and they can join one or make their own.

**Recommendations**

Students can already get some credit for personal projects by taking various
upper-level classes (CS 497R and 498R, and possibly 494 and 495), but you can't
take more than two semesters of them. I took two semesters of 497R and it was a
great experience. A good strategy for the CS department could be pushing more
students to take classes like these and gradually allowing students to take them
for more semesters.

I recommend that the department create a Slack workspace like the one mentioned
above and advertise it in their department emails. It would be a place where
students could form teams and then apply for 497R and 498R projects together.
If results are good, the department then can work on setting up a better system
for these projects so there isn't a large burden put on faculty mentors. Then
the department could start increasing the number of semesters that students can
do these projects for, and they could start pushing younger students to
participate.

For companies, I recommend taking advantage of CS 494 and 495, the capstone
courses. But instead of giving students a project to work on, let them submit
applications to work on their own projects. Help students form teams and choose
the best projects for them to work on. This would help the company identify and
attract full-time job candidates, and the students that do join full-time will
be able to give better referrals. If things go well, the system could be scaled
up by paying students to do the same things as a part-time job.
