Recently I've been thinking about two different mindsets: a
production mindset and a learning mindset. Whenever I'm working, I have
predominantly one or the other. The production mindset is characterized by
efficiency and output. You try to accomplish as much as possible with the
least amount of resources. You make heavy use of the 80/20 rule, only doing
things that are essential. You get things done. The learning mindset is
characterized by curiosity and growth. You take time to explore different
possibilities. You're not worried about meeting a deadline. You don't care
about "wasted effort."

This distinction came to mind as I was building a prototype web application in
my spare time. I was trying to hook up Sente and Pedestal (two Clojure
libraries for web sockets and HTTP routing, respectively). I didn't find any
examples demonstrating this, but I followed the instructions on Sente's Github
page. Unfortunately I ended up with a bug that I didn't understand nor know how
to fix. I did more Googling, asked a friend for help and was considering
messaging Sente's author. However, I looked at Sente's source code a bit and
found out that it wasn't terribly long. Instead of groping around in the dark,
I could delve into the code to deepen my understanding of what was actually
going on.

This also made sense because I wasn't in a rush. The whole point of building
this prototype was to help me learn more about building web applications, so
why not take the time to understand how a websocket library works under the
hood? It seemed like such a novel idea to me, and now I realize it's because
I'd spent the past seven years in a production mindset.

Seven years ago is when I started college, and until I graduated it was a
constant struggle to finish homework, complete projects and prepare for exams.
I was happy if I got enough sleep every night. So of course I had a production
mindset&mdash;I needed to finish my coursework efficiently just to keep a healthy
balance in my life. My time on the job since graduating has similarly had a
production mindset not because I'm being pushed by deadlines all the time (I'm
not) but because... it's a job. Our customers want features X, Y and Z, and
I'm being paid to help get it done.

However, there was a time when I had a learning mindset: high school. I was
home schooled up until starting college, and my parents gave me a lot of
flexibility. In high school I started diving into programming and Linux. I
learned on my own from my own motivations. When I had an idea for a new
program to write, I'd pause my work in other subjects while I focused on
programming. Since I was being motivated by curiosity and enjoyment, I took my
time to learn new things. It was great. When the project wrapped up, I would
catch up in my other subjects. Then the cycle would repeat.

I look back on my high school years with fondness. I learned so much. If I have
any regrets about my college education, it's that I spent practically the
entire time in a production mindset. It certainly helped to develop character
traits like diligence, but it wasn't the best for gaining knowledge.
All in all, I have this gut feeling that I could've become much more with a
learning mindset.

But that being said, what would I have done differently? Quit my part-time job?
I learned a lot from that, and I appreciated the financial independence it gave
me. Should I have taken fewer credits? That would've disqualified me from
scholarships. Maybe I should've allowed my GPA to fall in order to free up
time. In any case, it was a difficult situation, and the right solution is
probably systemic.

This idea opens up a few more questions; for example, can you have an even mix
of learning and production mindsets? Or does it have to be primarily one or the
other? How can a learning mindset be facilitated at school and work? As an
individual, how can you create room in your life for a learning mindset?
Perhaps I'll think more about these questions in another essay, but for now,
I'm itching to spend more time learning for the sake of learning. More on that
in my next essay.
