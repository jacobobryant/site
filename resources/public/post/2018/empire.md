[I've written](../dream/) about the meaning of my life, which is to help others
spend their lives doing things that are worth all their time and attention.
This essay describes my current plans for doing that. I think that building my
own empire will be the most effective way to accomplish that at scale.

First, we need to create a successful startup. This will be the
starting point of the empire. Although my current main startup idea is
a music-related, there are far bigger problems that we could start to
address as the startup scales.

For one, the formal education system is highly inefficient for
programmers who want to be startup founders, at least judging by my
experience at BYU. The ratio of time and effort spent to learning
achieved is far too low. It's also too hard to meet potential
cofounders. See [this essay](../byucs) for more information. I've also
written [more generally](../../2017/education/) about problems with
education.

Second, after graduating it's also been somewhat painful for me to
work full-time at a regular software company, even a good one like
Lucid. I have learned good stuff and I work with great people, but the
experience still feels watered down because the main focus is just
meeting random business needs of customers. I still have the problem
that I work there 9-5, but I come home and want to work on my other
projects. I want something instead that I can throw my whole soul
into.

**People**

First make the company the best place to work for people who want to
be startup founders. Focus on pushing the limits of technology, not
just satisfying customers and making money.[1] Make it a place where
programmers will learn tons of stuff. Also make it a good place to get
potential cofounders. Have lenient contract terms so people can work
there for a little while and then go off with other employees and make
new companies.

As much as possible, try to hold on to these new companies. The company could
start turning partially into a sort-of startup incubator/investment thing. When
the new startups are related to the current company, consider acquiring them.
Diversify and grow the business like Google.

Fill the funnel with good programmers by solving the earlier education problems.
See the aforementioned essay for possible solutions. Create a higher-learning
experience that is ridiculously hard but worth programmers' energy. Make it
replace a typical computer science degree. Link it to the company so the
students will come work at the company after they finish (or they could
immediately create their own startup and maybe get acquired by the company).

In both phases, make it something that programmers can put their whole soul into
during the time they're there. Inasmuch as they have their own ideas for
projects, this will probably involve enabling them to work on these projects.

Start at the very beginning of the process. Make the introduction to
programming better for not-yet-programmers, and focus on
middle-school/high-school age people. Make bonds with the great
programmers long before other companies' recruitment process even
begins.

This funnel of insanely great programmers and startups will help the company
turn into a real empire. If we have the best programmers, it's only a matter of
time before we start to displace the current tech giants.

Large companies have a huge weakness here: their job application processes are
long and arduous. If we can keep ours light, even as the company scales, we'll
have a major advantage in getting the best people first.
Also see [Sam Altman's
thoughts](https://blog.samaltman.com/advice-for-ambitious-19-year-olds) about
why working for big/high-paying companies is often a bad idea. (Search for
"Incidentally, don’t let salary be a factor.")

**Business models**

In addition to relying on better programmers, we
can rely on another general strategy: better business models.
Google's business, like many in the industry, is based off advertisement. This
drives them to collect and exploit user information, often in opposition to what's actually
best for their users.

So as we develop new technologies, we also should be innovative with
our business models. We'll try to figure out ways to not rely on advertisement,
but still make systems that are profitable and loved by users. (Or we could still do advertisement, but
find a way to remove the negative externalities).

It would also be great to apply innovative business models to open source
development. These open-source projects are a critical part of the software
industry's infrastructure, but they have [major sustainability
problems](https://www.fordfoundation.org/media/2976/roads-and-bridges-the-unseen-labor-behind-our-digital-infrastructure.pdf)
currently.

These two strategies of better programmers/technology/innovation and better
business models will hopefully drive us to the top. Furthermore, it would
fulfill all my specific career-related life goals:

- Create a successful startup
- Fix education
- Help make the tech industry great again (i.e. make it enjoyable to work in and
   make it continue to push civilization forward in a sustainable way that
   doesn't undermine things like freedom and privacy)

**Notes**

[1] From the dedication of SICP: "I think that it’s extraordinarily important
that we in computer science keep fun in computing. When it started out, it was
an awful lot of fun. Of course, the paying customers got shafted every now and
then, and after a while we began to take their complaints seriously. We began to
feel as if we really were responsible for the successful, error-free perfect use
of these machines. I don’t think we are. I think we’re responsible for
stretching them, setting them off in new directions, and keeping fun in the
house. I hope the field of computer science never loses its sense of fun."
