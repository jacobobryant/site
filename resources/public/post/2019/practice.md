*[My last post](/post/2019/future/) was a mental dump related to creating a
work/education organization with a specific culture. This is a more
focused, clarified version of that post.*

Programmers don't get enough time to practice. We should be more like musicians.
I'm a clarinetist, and I think we can make some useful analogies. Becoming a great
musician involves at least four areas:

* Performing
* Rehearsing
* Practicing
* A bit of theory

(Rehearsing is practicing a specific piece meant for later public performance, whether
individually or as a group. By practicing, I mean practicing things like scales, articulation,
intonation, etc.)

Great programmers need to spend time in four similar areas:

* Performing: Releasing
* Rehearsing: Writing code for work (or school projects)
* Practicing: Working on your own projects
* Theory: computer science

Individually, we know the value of practicing (employers know that it signals "passion"&mdash;a
rant for another time). However, our institutions don't reflect that knowledge. Imagine
trying to get a degree in music performance if you only practiced scales ad-hoc&mdash;whenever
you had a lull in your other obligations. And yet that's what happens to computer science
majors. Instead of practicing, you spend too much time on rehearsing and theory. Anyone
involved with interviewing recent CS grads knows the result.

It's a little better after graduation. If you get a nine-to-five, at least your evenings and
weekends are a bit more protected. Maybe you even have an enlightened employer that gives
you 20% time ("Good news, musicians&mdash;we're now going to let you practice scales every
Friday!").

Why is it like this? I think it's because if musicians stop practicing, you notice more
quickly. If I went to an orchestra rehearsal after a week of not practicing, my fingers
would feel sluggish and my lips would hurt. Practicing as a musician is possibly as much
about retaining your current skill as it is about improving. But in programming, your skills
don't regress so quickly: practicing is more about just improving your skills. So when we
don't practice, we don't feel an immediate, negative reward. We just miss out on the
better skills we could've had.

My argument is simple: programmers would have higher output over the long run if they could spend
more time on their own projects, learning autonomously.[1] Here's my plan to test this
hypothesis:

1. Create this lifestyle for myself as a consultant. I prefer to work on one thing at a
   time, so the best situation would probably be working on a contract for N weeks and
   then spending the next M weeks working on a personal project.

2. As I build my own consulting business, hire other programmers and create a culture
   that supports this lifestyle.

3. As the organization scales, there will likely be some personal projects that could grow
   organically into good products. We'd gradually switch work from consulting over to
   working on these products, since selling our own software can have higher gains than
   renting out our time.

I'm just getting started as a consultant myself. From my limited reading, it seems that
with some work you can expect to make much more than you would as an employee&mdash;that's good
because it'll make it easier to support myself without spending all my time working for
money. However, I've also read that creating a profitable non-solo consulting business is
really hard. Now it's a distributed system instead of a single entity, and you have to
deal with the associated overhead.

I'm hoping I can overcome this challenge like so:

* Short-term: I also hypothesize that there's a demographic of programmers who 1) are
  highly competent, but 2) want to spend time on their own projects, and 3) aren't
  interested in being a startup founder (or are interested but aren't ready). Building
  an organization for these people could make it easier to be profitable since top
  performers have higher margins.

* Long-term: If my original hypothesis is correct, our programmers will have
  higher-than-normal output (and thus higher margins) due to extra time spent practicing.

There are more implications, but that's the plan. Wish me luck.
