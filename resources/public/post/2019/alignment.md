Should you work hard? Depending on your definition of "hard," it's a
[controversial question](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1067173497909141504). Let's assume a
baseline level of hardness is roughly 40 hours per week of mostly focused work.
In other words, this is your typical "good employee" at a 9-to-5: they do their
time and they do good work, then they go home and focus on other things. This
is very respectable.

What about going above and beyond? There are two sides to this. Bronnie Ware
says that one of the top five [regrets of the
dying](https://bronnieware.com/blog/regrets-of-the-dying/) is "I wish I
hadn't worked so hard":

> This came from every male patient that I nursed. They missed their children's
> youth and their partner's companionship. Women also spoke of this regret. But
> as most were from an older generation, many of the female patients had not been
> breadwinners. All of the men I nursed deeply regretted spending so much of
> their lives on the treadmill of a work existence.

On the other hand, we can probably all think of several highly successful people
who worked more than 40 hours per week. My favorite example is Henry Eyring, the
chemist. [His
biography](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2300985.Mormon_Scientist) is one
of the few books I've read twice, and he's one of my personal role models. He
was ambitious, worked extremely hard and achieved a lot&mdash;but he did this without
compromising on anything more important. He was a good husband, father, teacher
and leader. He touched the lives of many.

There are additional arguments for both sides of the debate. But what's the
resolution to this paradox? I think it's something that I've started calling
"alignment." Alignment is the situation in which there's a high correlation
between the effort you put into life and the good that comes out. In other
words, it's when your work is aligned with what's most important.

I hypothesize that the real problem with many of Bonnie
Ware's patients wasn't that they worked too hard&mdash;the problem is that they
worked too hard on things that, at the end of the day, weren't as important to
them as they thought. Notice that the #1 regret was "I wish I'd had the
courage to live a life true to myself, not the life others expected of me."
Perhaps the regret of working too hard was really just a symptom of this deeper
regret.

If you want to spend your life working really hard, it's critical to mould
yourself and your situation until working hard is actually worth it. Otherwise
you have two bad choices:

- Work hard and later regret that you neglected more important things
- Don't work hard and later regret that you didn't fulfill your dreams

I really like [Sam Altman's
advice](http://blog.samaltman.com/how-to-be-successful) on "how to
achieve outlier success." I think it describes well this idea of alignment:

I've had several different experiences with alignment over the past six years:

- For a large, early chunk of my mission, I was completely out of alignment.
   I didn't enjoy being a missionary at all&mdash;it was a living hell&mdash;and it seemed
   like our efforts didn't make a difference anyway.

- I changed a lot partway through my mission. One of the things I most enjoyed
   about the end of my mission was the satisfaction of working hard all day, every
   day on something that mattered.

- Although my experience at BYU was positive overall, there was lots of
   pressure from the system to work very hard, even though a large chunk of my
   time was spent on things that didn't contribute to my education (this
   category includes a lot of homework, most lectures, and almost all exams).

- Being an employee was alright. I went in with the desire to make a real
   contribution to Lucid and I like to think I achieved that goal. Although it
   wasn't the work I wanted to spend the rest of my life on, I did learn a lot
   and the money I saved up is a great benefit to me now.

- Now that I've quit my job and have become a startup founder, it's
   the first time since my mission where 
   I feel that I have perfect alignment. I work a
   lot, but it doesn't feel like work. I don't look forward to the weekends
   anymore; I love every day. Things will get more stressful as we progress, but
   I'm excited.

For me, having alignment means being a startup founder because I'm ambitious and
there are specific things I want to build&mdash;I'm not satisfied by working on
whatever the company that hired me happens to be building. But all that being
said, alignment is important for everyone, regardless of what your individual
goals and desires are. As with most [hard
things](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18176747-the-hard-thing-about-hard-things),
there's no formula for alignment. You have to figure out what it means for you
and how to get it. But being aware of the concept is at least the first step.

I write this all as a reminder to myself. I hope my life never falls out
of alignment.
