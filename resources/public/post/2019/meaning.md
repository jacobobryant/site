In Man's Search for Meaning, Viktor Frankl argues that meaning in life can come from three
sources: from loving someone, from accomplishing some great work, or from suffering.[1] I
have a hypothesis that most people are predisposed towards one of the first two
sources and (ideally) end up getting plenty of all three.

For example, I've noticed that one of the primary benefits of hard work is the
relationships you build along the way. Inversely, you can indirectly have a large impact
on the world by touching the lives of those around you. (And suffering will happen no
matter what you do).

It's ok to be either kind of person (or some other kind of person, since generalizations
like these don't fit everyone well). There is a misguided form of ambition that doesn't
yield good results, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't dream big if you want to.

There are probably other implications that you could tease out. In general I think it's
helpful to understand what kind of person you are and accept those who are different.

**Notes**

[1] There's some controversy about Frankl, but regardless I think it's a useful way to
frame the problem. Paul Graham framed it basically this way [in a
tweet](https://twitter.com/paulg/status/1073864964753055744).
