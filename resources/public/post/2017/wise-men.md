I recently read [The Wise Men: Six Friends and the World They
Made](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wise_Men_\(book\)). It's a book about a
handful of people in the WWII era who worked together to shape US foreign
policy. It's a long, detailed book, but I enjoyed it. It gives a view from the
eyes of real people who made history. In addition to being informative, this
book showed that a few people really can change the world. The ending was
particularly powerful. I was inspired by the life stories of these six people.
Each of them served their country diligently until the end. I felt gratitude
towards them. It caused me to more deeply ponder what I want to accomplish with
my own life. The book made me realize how greatly we need good people who
dedicate their lives to the service of others.
